# TestRail-JIRA-Selenium-Integration
This project contains integration between TestRail, JIRA and Selenium where automation test execution results will be pushed to TestRail and defects will be linked with JIRA stories.

We can integrate test management tool like TestRail where our manual test cases are availabel and we execute these cases on sprint basis. Now we can push our automation test results 
to TestRail. In addition, we can link any failure with the JIRA story after linking JIRA and TestRail.

This will help us to find code coverage in test automation using manual and automation test case metrics.

Following tools are used to achieve this:
- Selenium
- TestNg
- Owner's Library
- Json-Simple
- AssertJ
